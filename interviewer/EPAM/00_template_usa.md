Python
1. Python Basics
# What will be the output:
sample = 'hello',
print(type(sample))

# What will be the output:
t2 = ([1,2,3,4], [5,6,7,8])
t2[0].append(10)
print(t2)

# What will be the output:
a = set('abracadabra')
print(a)

# Given a list, use list slicing to get the expected output:
lst = [1,2,3,4,5]
# Expected Output: [5, 3, 1]


2. Python Exceptions and Troubleshooting
# How to create a custom exception class

3. Python Functions and Decorators
# What are decorators?

4. Python Interpreters
# Is Python a complied or interpreted language?
# What does it means to be an interpreted language?
5. Python OOP
# What is the diamond shaped inheritance problem?

6. Python Asynchronous Programming
# How to write asynchoronous code in Python?
# How does it actually work at the backend?

7. Python Coding Problem
# Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.
# k can be any finite integer value.
# Input: 
nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
k = 3
# Output: 
[5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

Networks
# What is the difference between a hub, switch and router?
Hub: Connects two or more Ethernet devices. Does not perform filtering. Least intelligent, least expensive and least complex
Switch: Connects two or more LAN devices. Filters packets before forwarding them. Similar to a hub, but more effective.
Router: Can connect devices or a LAN and WAN. Highly configured to filter and send packets. Extremely smart and complex.
