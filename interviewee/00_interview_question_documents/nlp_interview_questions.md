1. What is NLP (Natural Language Processing)?
- Field of Computer Science that deals with communication between computer systems and humans
- A stream of AI that deals with processing human languages.
- Additionally, python supports objects, modules, threads, exception-handling, and automatic memory management
***

2. Real-life applications of NLP?
- Google Translate
- Chatbots
***

3. What are Stop Words?
- Words that bind the sentences but do not add to meaning.
- Articles, prepositions etc
- In NLPs context, Stop Words are generally ignored while interpreting the meaning
***

4. What is NLTK?
- NLTK is a python library that stands for 'Natural Language Toolkit'.
- It helps with:
    * Parsing
    * Tokenization
    * Lemmatization
    * Stemming
***

5. What is Syntactic Analysis?
- Techniqe of analyzing sentences for extracting meaning from it.
- Using syntactic analysis, a machine can analyse and understand the order of words arranged in a sentence.

- Syntactic Analysis flow:
    * Parsing: Helps in deciding the strucutre of a sentence or text in a document. It helps in analyzing the words in the text based on the grammar of the language.
    * Word Segmentation: The segmentation of words segregates the text into small significant units.
    * Morphological Segmentation: The purpose of morphological segmentation is to break words into their base form.
    * Stemming: It is the process of removing the suffix from a word to obtain its root word.
    * Lemmatization: It helps combine words using suffixes, without altering the meaning of the word.

6. What is Sementic Analysis?
- Sementic analysis helps make a machine understand the meaning of a text.
- It uses various algorithms for the interpretation of words in sentences.
- It also helps in understanding the structure of a sentence.

- Techniques:
    * Named entity recognition: Process of information retrieval that helps identify entities such as the name of the person, organization, place, time, emotion etc
    * Word sense disambiguation: It helps identify the sense of a word used in different sentences
    * Natural language generation: It is a process used by the software to convert structured data into human spoken language.

7. List the components of NLP.
- Entity Extraction: It refers to the retrieval of information by segmentation of sentence. It helps with recognition of an entity in a text.
- Syntactic Analysis: Syntactic analysis helps draw the specific meaning of a text
- Pragmatic Analysis: Process of finding useful information from text
