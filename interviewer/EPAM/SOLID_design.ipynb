    "# 1. What are SOLID principles?\n",
    "#  SOLID Principles is an acronym of 5 principles in Object Oriented Design (OOD). \n",
    "#     S - Single Responsibility Principle - every module or class should be responsible for single functionality\n",
    "#     O - Open Closed Principle - a class, component or entity should be open for extension but close for modification\n",
    "#     L - Liskov Substitution Principle - objects in a program can be replaced by the instances of their subtypes without modifying the correctness of a program\n",
    "#     I - Interface Segregation Principle - use many client specific interfaces instead of one general purpose interface\n",
    "#     D - Dependency Inversion Principle - high level modules should not depend on low level modules; both should depend on abstractions"
