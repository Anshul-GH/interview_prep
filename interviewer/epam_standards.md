Some hints on the in-depth check of a candidate's skills during an interview:

Ask for a story:
    Describe how the _______ was organized on your project?

Ask problem-solution questions:
    What problems have you faced while _____?
    How did you fix it?
    What have you done to prevent such _____ in future?

Focus on the experience:
    How did you implement _______?
    When and for what did you utilize _______?

Use open-ended clarifying questions:
    How? How do you know it is _______?
    What? What do you do when ________?
    Why? Why ________ is important for _____?

Some more tips:
    Use the power of silence.
    Ask complex questions by parts.
    Apply active listening (don’t interrupt)

You might ask how it’s possible to assess soft skills since they’re not something accurate, specific, and all of them general enough. The answer is lighting up the night sky. It’s the S.T.A.R. technique.

Definition.

An interviewer provides an imaginable situation an interviewee might face and gives a task. An interviewee should explain an action in a particular case and highlight a result, explain what behavior led to that. The exciting thing about the technique is that it can be used for structuring responses as well. For instance, you’re able to use it for describing some real situations in the past.

And this brings us to the examples of starry questions:

    Explain your largest failure at work. What did you learn from this experience? And how did you cope with it?
    Imagine the situation, one day employees disagreed with your decision. What would be your actions?
    Your customer is disappointed with the productivity of your junior teammate and really appreciates another one’s progress. A customer asks you to look into the problem and figure out the possible reasons. How are you going to deal with it? What might be an outcome?

Let’s try to answer the first one.

Well, to begin with, I’d specify the situation: “Several years ago, on one of the previous projects I committed the change that introduced the critical error on the production service.”

Task: “My project manager informed me that I need to fix it as soon as possible.”

Action: “That’s why I decided not to sleep that night and find the way to get the service working again, I carried out the hot fix and released it shortly after.”

Result: “Starting from that time, I’m checking the changes several times on the local machine and asking other engineers to verify it too.”

Such questions that they do not have any certain answers, a candidate just shares the experience they have and that’s all. Then an interviewer decides if it’s ok for him or not. Nevertheless, I believe the idea of how to use the S.T.A.R. as a response technique is clear now.
Tips for Checking Soft Skills

Ability to learn

    If a candidate has been using the same technology stack or performed the same duties for more than 4-5 years, ask him or her what the reason was.
    Ask if the candidate started to learn anything new, whose initiative it was, and what the reason for that was.


Communication

Pay attention to the following:

    The candidate articulation and representation of his or her idea.
    The candidate's behavior when presenting near the whiteboard or during a call.
    The clarification questions that the candidate asks.


Critical thinking

When a candidate describes the project:

    Ask if there are any processes that he or she can improve. If so, ask what the candidate can suggest or has suggested.
    Ask if the candidate has ever suggested any improvements to any projects and if they worked.


Leadership

    Ask if a candidate has ever coordinated or managed people in any activity, what it was and how he or she did it.
    Ask if a candidate has ever suggested any improvement or changes in the process and if he managed to put them into practice.


Problem solving

    Ask about the candidate's experience in solving conflicts or any problematic situations.


Reliability and team work

Pay attention to the following indicators:

    How the candidate speaks about his or her company, team, project, customer, i.e., whether he or she blames them without any grounded reason.
    How the candidate makes estimations and how he or she behaves when the estimations are wrong.
    How the candidate plans to transfer his or her duties when changing the job; how much time it will take and why.


Stress resistance

Here are the most common stressful situations that may be experienced at any project role within EPAM:

    High level of responsibility
    Fast changing environment
    Multitasking
    High level of uncertainty

Below are tips on how to reveal the candidate's behavior in such situations:

    Ask about an ideal or preferable project and issues the candidate would like to avoid.
    During a practical task, suggest some changes to the initial task and see if the candidate is able to rework this.
    Try to be quick enough when asking supplementary questions. 
    Check how the candidate would behave only in those stressful situations that may arise during the work on the target position. Avoid any situations related to physical harassment.
