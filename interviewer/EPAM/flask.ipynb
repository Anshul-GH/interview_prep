    "# 1. Why is Flask called a Microframework?\n",
    "# Answer: Flask is called a microframework because Flask only provides core features such as request, routing, and blueprints. \n",
    "# For other features, such as Caching, ORM, forms, etc., we need to make use of Flask-Extensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. What do you mean by template engines in the Flask framework?\n",
    "# Answer: A template is a file that contains two types of data, i.e., static and dynamic. \n",
    "# Dynamic data in a template is populated during run time. \n",
    "# Flask makes use of Jinja2 template engine to let developers create HTML templates with placeholders for dynamic data.\n",
    "# These placeholders can be filled during run time by using Flaskâ€™s render_template method with required parameters and values\n",
